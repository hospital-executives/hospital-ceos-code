This folder contains the code to create the cleaned HIMSS files.

From the root of this directory, you should be able to run 'make' in terminal
and completely regenerate the two final products:
1) final_himss.feather, from which we can build our data for machine learning 
in the RCC
2) final_confirmed.dta, from which Maggie and Ambar can conduct their data
analysis

This folder contains two subfolders:
1) helper-scripts, which contains all helper files necessary to generate the
aforementioned files
2) aux-scripts, which contains Katherine's exploratory work at different stages
of the process
