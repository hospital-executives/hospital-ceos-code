				* mcrnum_y is 21311 (matches M&A)
		* south peninsula hospital / SOUTH PENINSULA HOSPITAL
			* medicarenumber in AHA is 020014 but in M&A it is 021313

	* one potential approach: use the mcrnum_y and medicarenumber to create a list of linked CCNs
		* try merging on each one. Maybe using interchangeable CCNs by accident.

* The hospital, once known as Tri-County Hospital, has existed for 50 years. The next closest hospitals are in Gainesville and Ocala. Lander said the hospital has taken a positive turn since Pagidipati purchased it in 2014, shortly after it went through bankruptcy reorganization in 2013.

	* Franciscan Health Indianapolis announced plans in 2008 to consolidate services from its Beech Grove[11] to its Indianapolis campus upon completion of an inpatient bed tower in 2011.[12] The first phase of the tower construction opened in April 2011.[13][14] The Beech Grove hospital closed all inpatient and emergency services in March 2012. Outpatient services are still available. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franciscan_Health_Indianapolis
